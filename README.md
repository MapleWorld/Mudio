# Piano Website

Got the idea from www.gangqinpu.com

A social community website that allows people to post, listen, teach, and share music, audio, and knowledge.

It provides easy access to various music sheet and audio file to the public. 

Be able to hear what the music piece sounds like will definitely help people in deciding if they would like to learn it or not, which saves their time and energy. Even if they are not planning to learn the instrument, it is still nice to hear some high quality and relaxing music. Hopefully, it will inspire and motivate others to learn instrument like it did to me.

Listening is the first step to learn anything.
