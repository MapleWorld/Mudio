# Piano Website
A social community piano website that allows people to post, listen, teach, and share music sheet and knowledge.

Got the idea from www.gangqinpu.com.
Personally, I really like this website and it helped me so much when I was first learning piano, it really inspired and motivated me to learn piano.

Be able to hear what the music sheet sounds like will definitely help people decide if they would like to learn it or not.

Listening is the first step to learn any instrument.
